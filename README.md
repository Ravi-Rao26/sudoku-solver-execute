# sudoku-solver-execute
This project hosts the exe file for sudoku puzzle. The exe file on execution presents a 9*9 grid. The user can enter the sudoku puzzle. The cells which are blank in the sudoku puzzle can be left as is. After entering the numbers, click on Save button and then click on Solve. The sudoku solution will be displayed in the UI. The sudoku solver code has been written in Python.

Please note the code solves sudoku in traditional format with 1-9 numbers present across the rows and columns and 1-9 present in the 9 blocks.

As a part of next step, Machine Learning solution will be attempted to solve the Sudoku puzzle. There have been successful attempts where in supervised learning approach has been followed and a CNN network has been trained to solve the sudoku puzzle. However reinforcement learning has been implemented to solve the Rubek's cube and it can be  implemented to solve sudoku puzzles as well. Writing the sudoku execution code in python has provided a very good learning and understanding in trying to formulate a strategy which can facilitate implementation of reinforcement learning.
